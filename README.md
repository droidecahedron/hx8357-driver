I like this screen, but I want to use it on various boards in C projects.
I translated their cpp stuff over to a C driver for anyone who would need it at some point.

Some of the defines at the top are specific to the TI C2000 board the [LAUNCHXL-F28379D]([url](https://www.ti.com/product/LAUNCHXL-F28379D/part-details/LAUNCHXL-F28379D?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ocb-tistore-promo-epd_opn_en-cpc-storeic-google-wwe&utm_content=Device&ds_k=LAUNCHXL-F28379D&DCM=yes&gclid=CjwKCAjww7KmBhAyEiwA5-PUSqU2pKhu6I2Sz4Ll8R00RY63aIk49X23yUcwhQmeDrHodHPjx5kQMhoCrhMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)https://www.ti.com/product/LAUNCHXL-F28379D/part-details/LAUNCHXL-F28379D?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ocb-tistore-promo-epd_opn_en-cpc-storeic-google-wwe&utm_content=Device&ds_k=LAUNCHXL-F28379D&DCM=yes&gclid=CjwKCAjww7KmBhAyEiwA5-PUSqU2pKhu6I2Sz4Ll8R00RY63aIk49X23yUcwhQmeDrHodHPjx5kQMhoCrhMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)


## Datasheet
the datasheet for the hx8357 can be found [HERE]([url](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/HX8357-D_DS_April2012.pdf)https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/HX8357-D_DS_April2012.pdf)

There's a lot more you can do with this than is provided in the driver here like scrolling, rotating, etc.
ping me if you want me to add it!
